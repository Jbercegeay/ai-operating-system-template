# Client AIOS Intake

This is the source-of-truth file for the client's AIOS. Fill it in by typing, voice-pasting, or running `$onboard` / `/onboard` for a guided conversation. Whichever mode, this file is what onboarding reads to scaffold the Day-1 setup.

**Hard cap: 7 client questions.** Each answerable in under 60 seconds. Don't overthink — you can edit and re-run onboarding any time.

## JB Automations Preflight — completed before Q1-Q7

These are setup fields for JB Automations. They are not part of the 7-question client intake.

**Operator mode**

```

**Client/business name**

```

```

## Q1 — What is this business, what does it sell, and who does it serve?

Business identity, offer, and ideal customer. One paragraph each is fine.

```

```

---

## Q2 — Paste 1-2 things you've written recently. Don't edit them.

An email, a LinkedIn post, a DM, a doc — anything that sounds like you when you're not trying. **Paste verbatim.** Do not type these mid-conversation with Claude — chat-shaped samples are worse than no samples (voice contamination).

```
[Sample 1 — paste raw]
```

```
[Sample 2 — paste raw]
```

---

## Q3 — What are your 2-3 biggest priorities for the next 90 days?

Quarterly priorities. Not yearly aspirations. Things that, if not done within 90 days, would make the operator say "we wasted the quarter."

```
1. [Priority 1]
2. [Priority 2]
3. [Priority 3]
```

---

## Q4 — Where does revenue actually land, and where is it tracked?

Multiple answers OK. Stripe? Skool? GoHighLevel? QuickBooks? A spreadsheet?

```

```

---

## Q5 — Where do you talk to customers, your team, and the outside world day-to-day?

Email (which one — Gmail / Outlook)? Slack? Teams? DMs (Skool / Discord / iMessage)? Phone?

```
[Your answer here]
```

---

## Q6 — Where do meeting recordings, notes, and important docs live?

Granola? Otter? Fireflies? Google Drive? Notion? Dropbox? A folder on your desktop you keep meaning to organize?

```
[Your answer here]
```

---

## Q7 — What's the one task that eats your week, and where do you currently track work?

The single biggest time-suck or recurring drudgery. Plus where tasks/projects live (ClickUp / Asana / Linear / Notion / a notebook).

```

When this file is filled, run `$onboard` or `/onboard` and the wizard will scaffold the Day-1 file set: `context/`, `references/voice.md`, populated `connections.md`, and a filled `CLAUDE.md` and/or `AGENTS.md`.
